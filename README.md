## Installation 
I assume that you already have **Davic** installed. If not, please install Davic first. 
In addition to Davic, you will also need **Gorilla/mux** framework. 
Executing the python script of this directory should help installing it: 
```
python myinstall.py
```

## Run
Assume that you are playing this sample app locally... 

#### Start the Server 
In command-line:  
```
go run main.go
```
